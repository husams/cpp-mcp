Cross-stage invariants:
  I1. requirements.md MUST contain acceptance criteria before architect dispatch.
  I2. All adr-*.md Status MUST NOT be "proposed" before developer dispatch.
  I3. plan.md MUST list exit-criteria commands before any developer dispatch.
  I4. test-report.md MUST exist with no open QA_DEFECT entries before devops dispatch.

Traceability chain:
  story (requirements.md) → ADR (adr-N.md) → code (plan.md files-to-touch) → test (test-report.md)
  Every plan.md story MUST reference the AC IDs it satisfies.
  Every test in test-report.md MUST reference the scenario ID it covers.

Failure taxonomy (named codes; ownership in parentheses):
  MISSING_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA  — requirements.md has a story without AC (product-manager)
  ADR_UNRESOLVED               — adr-*.md Status == "proposed" at dev dispatch time (architect)
  MISSING_EXIT_CRITERIA        — plan.md story has no exit-criteria commands (senior-developer)
  TEST_FAIL                    — exit-gate test command non-zero (developer)
  LINT_FAIL                    — exit-gate lint command non-zero (developer)
  BUILD_FAIL                   — exit-gate build/formatter command non-zero (developer)
  REVIEW_BLOCK                 — review.md verdict == changes-requested with open finding-ids (senior-developer)
  QA_DEFECT                    — test-report.md lists unresolved defect IDs (qa-engineer)
  DEPLOY_DRIFT                 — deploy-notes.md context != current-context at apply time (devops)

Retry termination rule:
  - Developer retry: exits when all LINT_FAIL/TEST_FAIL/BUILD_FAIL codes clear (max 3 passes inside developer).
  - Developer-from-review retry: exits when all REVIEW_BLOCK finding-ids are addressed.
  - Developer-from-qa retry: exits when all QA_DEFECT ids in test-report.md are resolved.
  Max 3 retry passes per signal set; surface to user if not resolved after exhaustion.

Handoff rule: all cross-agent data passes as file paths; never inline content from one agent into another dispatch.
